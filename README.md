# Password-saver
A simple program to save my passwords

Program gets user inputs and saves it as a key-value pair in binary file encoding it against a given key 
which uses xord to change the password so that I cannot be accessed from the .bin file.

You can save a new entry or get an existing password.

The examples stored in the password_example.bin are encoded using key "test" if you fancy playing around with the code.

For the future, I will develop a function to erase a given entry and also wrap it all into GUI (PyQt5).
